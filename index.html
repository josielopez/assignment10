    <h1>Black and White Photography</h1>

  <h3>A Temporary Blog Topic by Josephine Lopez</h3>
  <p>This week, I learned how to set up event listeners with jQuery to add a fun, interactive and useful element to a web page. I also learned how to upload files to make a live page for the first time. I don't have any experience whatsoever with web design or uploading content like this, so it was pretty exciting for me to be able to figure it out. View <a href="https://github.com/macloo/jquery-beginners-2018">my GitHub repo</a>.</p>

    <p>Take your photography to the next level by shooting in black and white.</p>
    <p>Below are four examples of using jQuery to illustrate the difference color, or lack of color, can make in a photo.</p>
    <p>Mouse over the images to compare the effects, or, if you are using a mobile device, use the blue buttons to apply the effects.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>1. Color can help highlight your subject.</h3>
<p>Most noticeably in colorful subjects. Check it out below.</p>
<button id="lobster" type="button" class="btn btn-info">Highight subject</button><p></p>
<div class = 'bluelobster col-sm'>
        <img class='bluelobster img-responsive' src="images/bwlobster.jpg" alt="Blue Lobster">

<h3>2. Greyscale can change the mood of your photo.</h3>
<p>A vibrant sunset becomes an interesting river of air coursing through plumes of smoke.</p>
<button id="changemood" type="button" class="btn btn-info">Change mood</button><p></p>
<div class = 'sunset col-sm'>
  <img class='sunset img-responsive' src="images/sunset.jpg" alt="Sunset">
</div>

<p></p>


<h3>3. You can also use it to mute the subject in your photo.</h3>
<p>Red and green are colors that are similar in shade and tone. Some color-blind individuals are unable to distinguish the two -- mouse over the image below to understand why.</p>
<button id="mutesubject" type="button" class="btn btn-info">Mute</button><p></p>
<div class='redgreen col-sm'>
  <img class='redgreen img-responsive' src="images/redgreen.jpg" alt="Red flower against green leaves">

<h3>4. Black and white photos can make an image feel more abstract.</h3>
<p>Did you recognize this New York Financial-Ditrict architecture? Clock "Toggle" to show and hide the image.</p>
<button id="slider" type="button" class="btn btn-info">Toggle</button><p></p>
  <div class="zoom">
    <img class='zoom col-sm img-responsive' src="images/zoom.jpg" alt="zoom">
